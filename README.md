# Filler

![Visualizer](/resources/Filler.gif)
Filler is making a champion to defeat tetris like game against other player.
To win this game, occupying more space compared to competitor.

my strategy is based on the `heat map` algorithm.

[filler.en.pdf](/resources/filler.en.pdf) is the task file.

## Project Structure

This project consists of two parts:

* Champion

## heatmap algorithm

Champion get piece randomly generated by virtual machine, then calculate the best position for surrounding the opponent.
like `flood fill`, recursively check valid and spread out to get the distance.
